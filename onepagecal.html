            <p>
                This unique calendar design, based on an article writen
                by <a href="https://bigthink.com/people/ethansiegel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Ethan
                        Siegel</strong></a>

                <strong>BigThink</strong>, shows an
                entire year on one page, making it
                easy to find dates and days of the week without flipping through months. Here's how to use it
                effectively:
            </p>

            <h3>Understanding the Layout</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Top page</strong>: The year (Leap years will be highlighted)</li>
                <li><strong>Top right</strong>: Months of the year (arranged by starting day of the week)</li>
                <li><strong>Top left</strong>: Days of the week (Sunday through Saturday)</li>
                <li><strong>Bottom left</strong>: Days of the month (1-31 in a standard calendar grid)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Finding What Day of the Week a Date Falls On</h3>
            <p><strong>When you know the month and date:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Place one finger on the desired <strong>month</strong> (top right)</li>
                <li>Place another finger on the desired <strong>date</strong> (bottom left)</li>
                <li>Slide the "month" finger <strong>down</strong> and the "date" finger <strong>right</strong>
                    until
                    they meet</li>
                <li>The day of the week where they intersect is your answer</li>
            </ol>
            <p><em>Example:</em> To find what day July 4th falls on, start with "July" at the top and "4" on the
                left,
                then slide until they meet at the day of the week.</p>

            <h3>Finding What Date a Specific Day Falls On</h3>
            <p><strong>When you know the month and day of the week:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start at the desired <strong>month</strong> (top right)</li>
                <li>Move your finger <strong>down</strong> to the desired <strong>day of the week</strong></li>
                <li>Move <strong>left</strong> to see which dates in the month fall on that day</li>
            </ol>
            <p><em>Example:</em> To find the fourth Thursday of November (Thanksgiving), start at "November,"
                move down
                to "Thursday," then move left to find the fourth occurrence.</p>

            <h3>Finding Which Months Have a Specific Date/Day Combination</h3>
            <p><strong>When you know the date and day of the week:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start at the desired <strong>date</strong> (bottom left)</li>
                <li>Move your finger <strong>right</strong> to the desired <strong>day of the week</strong></li>
                <li>Move <strong>up</strong> to see which months contain this combination</li>
            </ol>
            <p><em>Example:</em> To find which months have a "Friday the 13th," start at "13," move right to
                "Friday,"
                then move up to see the matching months.</p>

            <h3>Key Month Information to Remember</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>31 days</strong>: January, March, May, July, August, October, December</li>
                <li><strong>30 days</strong>: April, June, September, November</li>
                <li><strong>28/29 days</strong>: February (28 in regular years, 29 in leap years)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use two fingers or hands when tracing from different starting points</li>
                <li>The calendar works for the entire year â€“ no need to flip pages</li>
                <li>Remember that months are grouped by their starting day of the week</li>
                <li>Take your time tracing the paths until the method becomes natural</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With a little practice, you'll find this one-page format much faster than traditional
                month-by-month
                calendars!
