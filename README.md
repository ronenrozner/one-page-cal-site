The One Page Calendar is inspired by the article writen by [**Ethan Siegel**](https://bigthink.com/people/ethansiegel/) found at [Big Think- One Page Calendar](https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/one-page-calendar/).

From the article:

- *Most of us need to refer to a calendar quite frequently to know what calendar date (day, month, year) corresponds to which day of the week.*
- *But rather than having to change your calendar every month, this one-page calendar works for the entire year to give you all the information you need, practically immediately.*
- *Even better: if you understand how it works, you’ll never need to buy another calendar again, as simply switching a few “boxes” around can renew your calendar for each year to come.*
